## About

This project automates the set-up process for cloud gaming on a Nvidia Tesla M60 GPU on Azure Standard NV6 VM.
The development of this project is heavily inspired by this [excellent guide](https://link.medium.com/wXD4ZJWb5T).

Cloud gaming technology:

* [Parsec](https://parsecgaming.com/)
* [Steam In-Home streaming](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_cat.php?id=112) using [ZeroTier](https://www.zerotier.com/) VPN

Installed software:

* Game launchers
  * [ ] Battle.net (soon)
  * [x] Epic Games Launcher
  * [ ] GOG Galaxy (soon)
  * [ ] Origin (soon)
  * [x] Steam
  * [ ] UPlay (soon)
* Software
  * [x] [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)
  * [x] [Nvidia Tesla](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/processFind.aspx?psid=75&pfid=783&osid=57&lid=1&whql=1&lang=en-us) drivers for Windows 10
  * [x] [Parsec](https://parsecgaming.com/) for game streaming
  * [x] [VB-CABLE](https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/) driver
  * [x] [ZeroTier One](https://www.zerotier.com/) for VPN

## Known issue

The only issue so far is about Steam In-Home streaming. Due to a bug, you cannot return to the Windows Desktop during your game session using ALT+TAB.

## Usage

### Create the infrastructure in Azure

* The only requirement is to have AZ CLI installed. You can use the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/)
* Do not forget to update the options values of the script ```create_vmss.sh```
* At the end, you will be prompted to choose your Windows **admin password**

```bash
rm -rf ~/azure-gaming
git clone https://github.com/nVentiveUX/azure-gaming.git
cd ~/azure-gaming

# Yvesub example
./create_vmss.sh \
    --subscription="8d8af6bf-9138-4d9d-a2e6-5bff1e3044c5" \
    --location="westeurope" \
    --rg-vnet="rg-net-shared-001" \
    --vnet-name="vnt-shared-001" \
    --subnet-name="snt-gaming-001" \
    --subnet="10.1.0.16/28" \
    --rg-vm="rg-inf-gaming-001" \
    --vm-name="vm-gaming-001" \
    --lb-name="lb-gaming-001"
```

### Configure the Virtual Machine

* Connect using RDP. *Click on the Windows key in the bottom-left corner, type "mstsc", and open on the app.*
* From powershell admin prompt, disable UAC and reboot.

```ps
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\policies\system" -Name EnableLUA -PropertyType DWord -Value 0 -Force
Write-host -ForegroundColor Yellow "Rebooting now..."; Start-Sleep -s 2; Restart-Computer
```

* From powershell admin prompt, run the 1st script

```ps
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://github.com/nVentiveUX/azure-gaming/raw/master/setup1.ps1", "C:\setup1.ps1")
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -File "C:\setup1.ps1"
```

* Reboot
* From powershell admin prompt run the 2nd script

```ps
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://github.com/nVentiveUX/azure-gaming/raw/master/setup2.ps1", "C:\setup2.ps1")
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -File "C:\setup2.ps1"
```

### Configure Parsec

On you local machine
* Install the [Parsec](https://parsecgaming.com/downloads) client
* Sign In

On the VM
* Sign In to Parsec using the same account and **Enable Hosting**
* Close the remote desktop connection using the shortcut ```C:\disconnect.lnk```
* Try to connect into the VM thought your local installation of Parsec
* On the VM, tick **Run when my computer starts** from the minimized icon into the task bar
* Reboot the VM... and you're done.

### Configure ZeroTier VPN

On you local machine
* Create a dedicated [ZeroTier network](https://my.zerotier.com/network)
  * [x] Certificate (Private Network) (_Access Control_)
  * [x] Enable Broadcast (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff)
  * [x] Auto-Assign from Range (_IPv4 Auto-Assign_)
  * [ ] All IPv6 stuff
* Install the client [ZeroTier One](https://download.zerotier.com/dist/ZeroTier%20One.msi), Sign In and  **Join the Network**
* Tick Preferences.../**Launch ZeroTier On StartUp** from the minimized icon into the task bar

On the VM
* Open ZeroTier One, Sign In and **Join the Network**
* Tick Preferences.../**Launch ZeroTier On StartUp** from the minimized icon into the task bar

### Configure Steam In-Home streaming

On you local machine
* Open Steam and Sign In to configure the client
* _In-Home Streaming_
  * [x] Enable streaming
  * [x] Beautiful
* _In-Home Streaming_ > Advanced Client Options, and Check only the following:
  * [x] - Limit bandwidth to 30 Mbits/s (do NOT set unlimited, it does not work)
  * [x] - Limit resolution to > Display resolution
  * [x] - Enable hardware decoding
  * [ ] - Display performance information (Press F6 to display it in-game)

On the VM
* Open Steam and Sign In to configure the client
* _In-Home Streaming_
  * [x] Enable streaming
* _In-Home Streaming_ > Advanced Host Options, and Check only the following:
  * [x] _Enable hardware encoding_
  * [x] _Prioritize network traffic_
  * [ ] _Prefer NvFBC capture methode_ See [Explanation: NvFBC, NvIFR, NvENC](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/homestream/discussions/0/451850849186356998/#c451850849191050105) for more info

Now, steam should see the Streaming VM. Try to launch a game !

## Delete the Azure infrastructure

```bash
az group delete --name rg-inf-gaming-001
```

## Futur

* [ ] Update VM SKU to [Standard_NV6s_v2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes-gpu#nvv2-series-preview) (awaiting end of preview)
* [ ] Update OS to Windows 10 1809 (```rs5-pron```), as soon as Nvidia drivers will be supported on this version. (See [Supported operating systems and drivers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/n-series-driver-setup#supported-operating-systems-and-drivers) for more details. We are using ```rs4-pron``` today.
